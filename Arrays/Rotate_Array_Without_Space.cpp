Question-
Rotating an Array
Given an array of size N. The task is to rotate array by D elements where D â‰¤ N.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 7
Arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
D = 2
Output: 3 4 5 6 7 1 2
Explanation: 
Rotate by 1: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1]
Rotate by 2: [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2]

              full array reverse and remember to keep k = k%n nahi to runtime error*/
